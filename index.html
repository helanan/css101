			<p>The method attribute specifies how to send form-data (the form-data is sent to the page specified in the action attribute). The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post"). Notes on GET: Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs.</p>

		<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
			<p>GET results in the entire contents of the submission being visible in the URL. If your form contains sensitive data, you should specify a value of POST for the method attribute. Since GET appends the form data to the current URL, it can only be used where the contents of the submission (including the complete URL) will result in a string that is 2048 characters long, or less. This is the maximum length of a URL. GET can only be used to send ASCII data.

		<p>When data is sent using POST, submitting the form twice will result in a duplicated entry. This can be a problem if the form is linked to a membership, purchase, or other one-time action. This is why users cannot bookmark the results of a form submission if the method is POST. Read more: http://html.com/attributes/form-method/#ixzz4W4L26f5a</p>
